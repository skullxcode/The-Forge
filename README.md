## 📖 About This Project

The Forge is a lightweight, static website built to showcase and document a complete design system. It's built with simplicity in mind, using only **HTML** and **CSS** without any JavaScript frameworks or complex build processes.

The site is structured to clearly present:
* **Foundations:** The core principles of the design system, such as colors.
* **Components:** The reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, cards, navigation).
* **Utilities:** Helper classes for spacing, typography, and layout.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key files:

* `index.html`: The main landing page for the design system.
* `colors.html`: Documentation for the color palette.
* `foundations.html`: A page detailing the foundational elements of the system.
* `components.html`: A gallery showcasing all UI components.
* `utilities.html`: A reference guide for utility classes.
* `style.css`: The single stylesheet that contains all the styling for the project and the design system components.

## How to Use
